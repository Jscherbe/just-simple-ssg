I want pages to contain everything all assets for a given page. 
That is if that's how you want to set it up.
- Each page should get rendered into an object with

Page:
  path: relative to content root
  resources: All files (list not in memory)(should be able to get these)
  depth information: for creating menus
  identifier: something unique (path if not given)

Large fields can leverage seperate files like the body to seperate the type of data
